Hikari
======

Hikari is a Mega Man/Rockman game clone. It's written in C++. The goal of this 
project is to create a faithful clone of the classic NES title "Mega Man" ("Rockman" in Japan).

The gameplay and physics are being modeled mostly after Mega Man 3, but may incorporate
elements from later Mega Man games.

The engine uses [JSON](http://www.json.org/) to store data and [Squirrel](http://www.squirrel-lang.org) for scripting.
